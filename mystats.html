            I love to sketch. I will always be ready to play any kind of games, rules doesnt matter.
             I try to keep myself self desciplined. I value words, so try to use them wisely.

        <h3>My favorite food id Dal-Rice</h3>
        <p>
            I love eating rich food but at the end of the day a good plate of dal and chawal or we call it rice 
            is the only difh which ultimately pleasures my senses and stomach. It doesn't have any high quality ingredients in it,
            but its simplicity is what maakes it a beautiful dish. Its warmth with that salty flavour and the essence
            of dal which is absorbed by the water it is cooked in, leads me to a heavenly experience.
