        <h3>Shimla</h3>
        <p>
            Shimla has colonial houses, market places, lakes and snow-capped mountains,
             making it <b>picturesque</b>. Shimla's beauty increases abundantly during the winters. 
            Being a capital city, Shimla is well-connected by all mediums of transport. 
            It is a good place for <b>adventure seekers</b> and people looking for quiet time in nature's lap.
